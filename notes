Notes on dataset construction
===

This dataset is created from dumps of wikipedia and wikidata from 05/20/2018:
    - enwiki-20180520-pages-articles-multistream.xml.bz2
    - latest-all.json.gz

Wikidata entities are linked to wikipedia articles using the "enwiki" property,
this mapping is stored in the `wiki.db` file. NOTE: In order to maximize the
number of matches we ignore case when looking up titles. Wikipedia article
titles are case-sensitive in general, so this causes a small number of
collisions.

Each entity can potentially have many aliases, the mapping from entity ids to
aliases is stored in the `alias.db` file.

Lastly, we store all relations in the `relation.db` file.

To produce the `.db` files from scratch, the wikidata dump needs to be piped to
one of the build scripts. E.g. to build the `alias.db` run:
```{bash}
zcat latest-all.json.gz | scripts/build_alias_db.py
```
see `scripts/build_alias_db.py --help` for additional options.

The 'enwiki' property alone is not sufficient to map all links from a wikipedia
article to wikidata entities. The reason for this is that sometimes a redirect
link may be used instead of a proper wikipedia page title. These redirects can
be added to the `wiki.db` by running:
```{bash}
scripts/add_redirects.py $WIKIPEDIA_DUMP_PATH wiki.db
```
